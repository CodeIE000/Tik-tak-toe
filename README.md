# Tik-Tak-Toe with a Twist!

This is the code repository for a modified version of the classic Tic-Tak-Toe game. The core gameplay remains the same: two players take turns marking a grid with X's and O's, aiming to achieve a winning line of three. However, this version introduces a twist on the traditional winning patterns, making for a more strategic and challenging experience.

### Note: The codebase used in this project is a combination of my own modifications and references from YouTube tutorials. 

## What's Included:

* HTML files for the game interface.
* CSS files for styling the game board and elements.
* JavaScript files containing the core game logic and functionality, including modifications to the winning conditions.

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine. 
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to launch the game.
