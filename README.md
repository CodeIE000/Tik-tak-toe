# Tik-Tak-Toe with a Twist!

This is the code repository for a modified version of the classic Tic-Tak-Toe game. The core gameplay remains the same: two players take turns marking a grid with X's and O's, aiming to achieve a winning line of three. However, this version introduces a twist on the traditional winning patterns, making for a more strategic and challenging experience.
